# vala-cogl
I learned something from [here](http://onagat.hatenablog.com/) and now I want to write my own code.

## Contents
  * **cogl-hello** — `cogl-hello` in Vala (original [here](https://github.com/GNOME/cogl/blob/master/examples/cogl-hello.c)) requires git version of Cogl (can not be built right now)
  * **cogl-info** — `cogl-info` utility reimplemented in Vala (original [here](https://github.com/GNOME/cogl/blob/master/examples/cogl-info.c)) with Cogl 2.0 API
  * **cogl1-clutter-animation** — just a basic 2D example with Clutter and Cogl 1.0 API
  * **cogl1-clutter-3d** — mostly a copy of [this](http://onagat.hatenablog.com/entry/2014/12/26/012601) with Clutter and Cogl 1.0 API
